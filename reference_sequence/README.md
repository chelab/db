NCBI annotation for small RNA is better than the ensembl version. So another reference (`Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.sncRNA.fa.gz`) which is based on NCBI database is created.
The `sncRNA` notation mean small non-coding RNA, which include:

| number | type           |
| ------ | -------------- |
| 1      | RNase-MRP-RNA  |
| 1      | RNase-P-RNA    |
| 1      | telomerase-RNA |
| 4      | Y-RNA          |
| 4      | vault-RNA      |
| 4      | scRNA          |
| 22     | rRNA           |
| 49     | scaRNA         |
| 122    | snRNA          |
| 298    | tRNA           |
| 1175   | snoRNA         |
| 1873   | premiRNA       |
