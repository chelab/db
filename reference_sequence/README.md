NCBI annotation for small RNA is better than the ensembl version. So another reference (`Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.sncRNA.fa.gz`) which is based on NCBI database is created.
The `sncRNA` notation mean small non-coding RNA, which include:

| number | type       |
| ------ | ---------- |
| 1      | telomerase |
| 2      | RNase      |
| 4      | scRNA      |
| 4      | vault_RNA  |
| 4      | Y_RNA      |
| 22     | rRNA       |
| 49     | scaRNA     |
| 122    | snRNA      |
| 298    | tRNA       |
| 1175   | snoRNA     |
| 1873   | premiRNA   |
